## Introduction

This repository serves as a central hub for web challenges that I encounter and tackle regularly. Web challenges can cover a wide range of topics, including security, front-end development, back-end development, and more. The goal is to enhance my skills and knowledge in web-related technologies.

## Challenge Categories

The challenges are organized into the following categories:

- **Security**: Challenges related to web security, such as XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.
- **Front-end Development**: Challenges focused on front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks.
- **Back-end Development**: Challenges related to server-side scripting, databases, APIs, and other back-end technologies.
- **Miscellaneous**: Any challenges that don't fit into the above categories.
